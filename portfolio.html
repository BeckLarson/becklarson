            <h3>Jagged Hero</h3>
            <p>This was my first three-person team project. The entire project has taken a total of 5 months as of now,
                and features a nearly complete RPG/ Puzzel solving theme. This project has been put on hold for now as
                several of the team members are pre-occupied by current jobs. </p>

            <h3>Digital Breakfast</h3>
            <p>After working on several projects I decided that it would be helpful if I knew how to create 3d assets.
                I
                set out to teach myself how to use Blender. I worked on this outside of school and my full-time job. As
                a
                result it took me four days to complete. This is the result of my first creation. </p>

            <h3>The Sands of Eden</h3>
            <p>After the creation of F.L.R.D. I was inspired to create my first solo project. While this game is still in pre-alpha phase it has a number of aspects already. The player plays as a robot named Adam. Adam is sent to a newly discovered planet named Evo Prime to attempt colonization. Searching the sands could have been lonely so Adam’s creatures gave him a sentinel companion named Lilith. Adam and Lilith roam the sands as they attempt to unlock the secrets hidden benith. 
                I quickly learned that it was impossible to make a proper game without custom assest, thus I was inspired to learn 3d art.</p>

            <h3>Fall of Light: Rise of Darkness</h3>
            <p>FLRD was my first attempt at creating a visually pleasing game. The game was designed for my college class with the parameter idea of “Everything falls apart.” The players quickly learned that they must knock down structures to advance to areas. The creation of the game tested my scripting, designing, and building skills. It includes a full 2 levels and was created in Unity. </p>

            <h3>Scrapper</h3>
            <p>Scrapper is a third-person, puzzle solving adventure game set in the distant apocalyptic future. While the player had no
                weapons, they could use a gravnul to pickup and move objects. This was the first semi-team project that I participated in during school. Each of us worked alone on oue
                own level, then worked togeather to combine them into one.</p>

            <h3>Gumball Funball</h3>
            <p>In college I was challenged to first recreate the famous Pong game. Then, expand upon it and turn it into a unique game that could stand independent from Pong. The result was Gumball Funball, a crazy mix between Pong, Soccer, and a maze. The game currently has 10 whole levels each with their own infuriating twist and challenge. </p>

            <h3>Grassy Picnic</h3>
            <p>This is the very first scene I ever created using Maya 3d. While it is obvious that there are many flaws present, it was still alot of fun and a great learning experiance. </p>

            <p>After working on several projects I decided that it would be helpful if I knew how to create 3d assets.
                I
                set out to teach myself how to use Blender. I worked on this outside of school and my full-time job. As
                a
                result it took me four days to complete. This is the result of my first creation. </p>

            <h3>Jagged Hero</h3>
            <p>This was my first three-person team project. The entire project has taken a total of 5 months as of now,
                and features a nearly complete RPG/ Puzzel solving theme. This project has been put on hold for now as
                several of the team members are pre-occupied by current jobs. </p>

            <h3>Scrapper</h3>
            <p>Scrapper is a third-person, puzzle solving adventure game set in the distant apocalyptic future. While the player had no
                weapons, they could use a gravnul to pickup and move objects. This was the first semi-team project that I participated in during school. Each of us worked alone on oue
                own level, then worked togeather to combine them into one.</p>

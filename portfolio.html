                                a team of 3 including me. Currently I am the level designer among other things. We plan to
                                release this game to the public within the next few months!

                                        how to create 3d assets. I set out to teach myself how to use Blender. I worked on this outside of school and my full-time job. As a result it took me four days to complete. This is the result of my first creation.

                                FLRD was my first attempt at creating a visually pleasing game. The game was designed for my college class with the parameter
                                idea of “Everything falls apart.” The players quickly learned that they must knock down structures
                                to advance to areas. The creation of the game tested my scripting, designing, and building
                                skills. It includes a full 2 levels and was created in Unity. </p>

                                still in pre-alpha phase it has a number of aspects already. The player plays as a robot
                                named Adam. Adam is sent to a newly discovered planet named Evo Prime to attempt colonization.
                                Searching the sands could have been lonely so Adam’s creatures gave him a sentinel companion
                                named Lilith. Adam and Lilith roam the sands as they attempt to unlock the secrets hidden
                                benith.
